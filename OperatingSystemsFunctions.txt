One function of a operating system is to manage processors. The operating system assigns order for which processes have access to the processor, and the processing time each processor has. This process is called scheduling. The operating system also keeps track of the status of processes by a program called a traffic controller. 

Another function of an operating system is to manage memory. Main memory is composed of a large array of bytes or words that are assigned to a specific address. The operating system keeps track of primary memory, where it determines which bytes are used by which program.

Another function of an operating system is to manage devices. The operating system manages devices through their drivers, and keeps track of all the devices connected to the computer. It also decides which process gets access to a device, and for how long.
